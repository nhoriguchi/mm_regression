ras-tolerance

When a hardware error occurs for a non corrected ras event the kernel can take
different actions. If the severity is fatal, the kernel panic immediately.

This driver allows to overwrite error severity to a lower level at runtime,
recoverable by default. It is useful for test.

NOTE: ONLY FOR TEST. Be sure what your are doing.
